# Business Analytics App

## Introduction
The Business Analytics App is designed to provide insights into sales data through interactive visualizations and metrics. It leverages a comprehensive dataset to help users analyze product performance and make informed decisions.

## Objective
The main objectives of the application include:
- Visualizing sales data to identify trends and patterns.
- Allowing users to filter data by date for targeted analysis.
- Providing insights into product performance through various metrics.

## Balance
The application strikes a balance between data analysis and user interaction, offering a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit. Users can easily navigate through the data and visualize key metrics without needing extensive technical knowledge.

## How it Works
- The `data.csv` file serves as the primary dataset, containing sales information such as order dates, regions, products, and pricing.
- The `main.py` file implements the core functionalities of the application, including loading the dataset, filtering data based on user-selected date ranges, and generating visualizations using libraries like Plotly and Seaborn.
- The dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` ensure that all necessary libraries are available for the application to function correctly.
