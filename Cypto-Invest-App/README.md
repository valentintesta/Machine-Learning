## About The Project
This is an application that fetches historical data on 1 index, 4 stocks, and 2 crypto currencies and performs analytical calculations to assist in conducting a relative analysis between the index and the crypto currencies to determine if a relationship exists and the type of relationship for the purpose of conducting portfolio analysis and Monte Carlo Simulation for forecasting potential future returns.

The user can experiment with many different variations of choices for portfolio analysis based on preferences and risk tolerance.


## Roadmap

### M.V.P.
### Provide the following:
 - User input for data parameters
 - Error catching logic for user input
 - Price correlations between assets
 - Asset Beta compared to Index
 - Correlation Heatmap
 - Sharpe Ratios
 - Hypothetical past portfolio performance
